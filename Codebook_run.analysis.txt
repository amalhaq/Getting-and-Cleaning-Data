Experiment Design
-----------------

The experiments were carried out by capturing 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial 
angular velocity, respectively from the accelerometer and gyroscope, embedded into a 
smartphone.  The measurement were recorded from 30 volunteers who wore the smartphone on
their waist, while they performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING).

Data Frames and Variables in RAW DATA
-------------------------------------

Xtrain Data Frame:  
This Data Frame contains **561** columns which corresponds to 561 different types of
measurements (variables) taken from the accelerometer and gyroscope. There were **7352** 
observation taken from 21 out of the 30 volunteers (70% of volunteers).  These columns 
don't have defined names.

Xtest Data Frame:
This Data Frame contains **561** columns which corresponds to 561 different types of
measurements (variables) taken from the accelerometer and gyroscope. There were **2947** 
observation taken from the remaining 7 volunteers who were not part of the training set 
(30% of volunteers).  These columns don't have defined names.

Variables names in the Xtest and Xtrain Data Frames:
V1 through V561

features Data Frame:
This Data Frame has **2 columns and 561 rows.** The first column only gives a count.  The 
second column has text values in each row.  These texts are actually the 561 different 
types of measurements, and correspond to the 561 columns in X train and X test Data Frames.
*These are still not entirely descriptive, contain typos, and abbreviate heavily.*

activity_labels Data Frame:
This Data Frame has **2 columns and 6 rows.** The second columns has text in each row.
These texts describe the different 6 activities for which the 561 measurements were taken.

Variable names in Features Data Frame: 
V1-V2 

Variable names in  activity_labels Data Frame:
V1-V2

The ytrain and ytest are 1 variable dataframes (variable names = V1).  They give the 
activity applicable to each of the 7352 and 2947 observations respectively, in Xtrain and 
Xtest.  **However, they are indexed 1-6.**

The subject_train and subject_test files are 1 variable data frames (variable names = V1).
They identify the volunteers from whom the 7352 and 2947 observations were taken on Xtrain
and Xtest respectively. **They are indexed 1-21 in Xtrain, and 22-30 in Xtest.**

README.md**


Approach
--------

To obtain one data set that included all the measurement observations, the activities for
which they had been taken, and the volunteer to which they corresponded, we merged the 
Xtrain and Xtest, the ytrain and ytest, and the subject_train and subject_test data
frames by rows, giving us **10299 rows**.

We then merge three resulting data frames into one big data frame by columns, 
giving us **563 columns**.  We added names to the columns by using the file features.txt 
and we named column 562 "activity", and 563 "subject".  Thus, we had a basic, compiled 
data frame of all the necessary variables.


Data Frames and Variables in TIDY DATA:
---------------------------------------

**subsetmerge** -- Data Frame resulting from steps 1-4 of assignment:
We want to get a data frame that only has those measurements from the 561 variables, that
provide either a 'mean' or a standard deviation'. We extract these columns (see README.md
for the code and appropriate functions to use for the extraction) as well as the "subject"
and "activity" columns.  We added the specific activity into "activity" column by using the
file activity_labels and the factor() function so that labels follow the 1-6 index.

Our column headers are untidy, so we make them descriptive and easy to read by using gsub.
Redundant words were removed and the following replacements were used:
	'mean()' was changed to 'mean'
	'std()' was changed to 'std'
	't' was changed to 'time'
	'f' was changed to 'frequency'
	'Acc' was changed to 'Acceleration'
	'Gyro' was changed to 'Gyroscope'
	'Mag' was changed to 'Magnitude'

**ResultDF** -- Independent Data Frame resulting from steps 5 of assignment:
We want to get a second, independent data frame that gives us an average of the measure-
ments for each of the 6 activities for each of the 30 volunteers.  The data frame 
**subsetmerge** still has our 10299 observations, because we have multiple observations for
each activity that a subject performs.

To get a data frame that gives only one measurement (eg., timeBodyAcceleration-mean-X) for
only one activity (eg., WALKING) for only one subject (eg., volunteer 1).  We have to group
the data by the 'subject' column, and then take the mean for each grouped variable.  
'dplyr package' works well for this purpose.

Thus we condense the multiple observations of an activity measurement into 1 observation.
We should have 30volunteers x 6 activities = 180 rows, which is what "ResultDF" has.
